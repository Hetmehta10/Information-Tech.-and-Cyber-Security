# 🔐 Information Technology & Cyber Security Projects

Welcome to the **Information Technology and Cyber Security** repository! This collection contains practical **Lab Files**, **Assignment Solutions**, and a real-world **Hackathon-Style Project** focused on IT and cyber security concepts using Python.

## 🧪 Lab Files (`LabFiles/`)

Contains focused exercises and demonstrations on key IT & security topics such as:

- System and network basics (e.g., SSH, sockets)
- Working with files, logs & parsing techniques
- Encryption/decryption, hashing (e.g., using `hashlib`)
- Simple client-server interaction scripts
- Practice with APIs and web requests (`requests`, `socket`)

These examples help build a solid foundation in both Python and cybersecurity techniques.

## 📝 Contribution Guidelines
🎯 All code is for educational purposes, the creator doesn't hold any responsibility towards the use of Bat Files and the follow ups from the Lab Report.

📝 Contributions and improvements welcomed (PRs, better error handling, test cases)

📌 Feel free to file issues or request new features

**Next Steps:**  
- Review and tweak section headers or examples to align with the actual project names and scripts in your repo.  
- Consider adding badges (e.g., Python version, license) or screenshots of CLI outputs for more visual appeal.

Let me know if you'd like help adding any of those!
